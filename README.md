## Cash-Code
Question: Implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents back to the customer. 

- If you input -1, does your program prompt you again?
- If you input 0, does your program output 0?
- If you input 1, does your program output 1 (one penny)?
- If you input 4, does your program output 4 (four pennies)?
- If you input 5, does your program output 1 (one nickel)?
- If you input 24, does your program output 6 (two dimes and four pennies)?
- If you input 25, does your program output 1 (one quarter)?
- If you input 26, does your program output 2 (one quarter and one penny)?
- If you input 99, does your program output 9 (three quarters, two dimes, and four pennies)?

## Scrabble-code
Question: Implement a program in C that determines the winner of a short Scrabble game. Your program should prompt for input twice: once for “Player 1” to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. Then, depending on which player scores the most points, your program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!”.


| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 8 | 4 | 10 |

For example, if we wanted to score the word “WIN”, we would note that the ‘W’ is worth 4 points, the ‘I’ is worth 1 point, the ‘N’ is worth 1 points. Summing these, we get that “WIN” is worth 6 points.
